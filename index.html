									<p>There are several channels these days through which one can market their product. Due to advancement of digital platforms and improvements in data infrastructures, companies are optimizing there advertising strategies in order to get maximum ROI. A very famous technique used to achieve this aim is "Market-Mix Modelling". The following project is a part of such marketing model which analyzes the effect 
									of different channel advertising on sales of Automobiles. The vehicles are further segmented into different categories to see how people targeting different class of vehicles reat differently to advertising channels </p>

									<h3><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/distracted-driver-detection-using-deep-learning-e893715e02a4">Distracted Driver Detection Using Computer Vision Techniques</a></h3>
									<p>During our fall semester, we were recently introduced to Neural Networks and Sequential Models. The complexity involved and the practical applications of these models really curated our interest in this field and thus we decided to learn more about Deep Learning and these models. On of the pratical applications is Computer Vision which works on Images and Videos as an input data and gives us the desired results. 
									   We wanted to know more about these techniques - how an image is taken as data, what happens when it goes into a model,how are such projects carried out, what are the latest advancements in this section etc. In order to solve these, my group members decided to take this Kaggle project which detects the Casual Drivers based on their activity. Its application is significant as we can see how many road fatalities occur on daily basis. 
									   This project aims at venturing out and telling basics about deep learning, working with image data, google cloud platform, computer vision, transfer learning, evaluations and metrics used, image augmentation and ensemble methods

									<p>During our fall semester, we learnt about Time Series Forecasting methods. One of the projects involved using XGBoost techniques by taking lags and cross sectional assumptions. As a further extention, I wanted to see how a simple neural network performs as compared to XGBoost in this scenario (though RNN, LSTMS are used, I went ahead with simple ANN). The project aims to forecast Peanut Butter Sales at different stores in Chicago region. It consists of EDA techniques
									used while handling such data along with basic techniques of sequential models.</p>

									<h3><a href="https://github.com/raisinghanijayant2611/Text-Analytics/tree/master/Crowd%20Source%20Recommendation%20Engine">Beer Recommendation Engine using Text Analytics</a></h3>
									<p> There are several recommendation websites at present, where we type in what we desire or have a chat with a bot, and get recommendations tailored to the words we put. One of the key algorithms used for this purpose is looking at the reviews of all the products, taking keywords from the input you provided and matching the products based on the similarity of the reviews and your comment as well as the sentiment behind it. For example, if you said "I want a Fruity beer with good aroma",
										The engine will look for similarity between the reviews and association with the word "Fruity" and "aroma", then it will take the sentiments to see whether people have positive opinion about the attributes and based on that a results are shown. As a part of our course in Fall Semester, my group and I have tried to make such a product using Selenium, SpaCy similarity and Vader Sentiment packages.   </p>

									<p>We generally think of Linear Regression as fitting a line that minimizes the sum of squares between the data points and the line itself. But how least square was chosen? How is it tied to the inferential and bayesian statistics? Through this post, I try to answer those questions. Hope  it helps</p>

									<h3><a href="https://github.com/raisinghanijayant2611/CAM-KERAS">Class Activation Maps - KERAS</a></h3>
									<p>One of the projects I did in fall semester was detecting driver activity using Computer Vision techniques (details in post section) where we compared different sequential models using evaluation metrics like log-loss. However, while presenting such projects to Business Stakeholders, it might become tricky to explain what the model is doing. Thus I was interested in researching a way to visualize what Convolutional 
									models differentiate between different classes and how to make the project more presentable to clients. I came across CAM functions which do a pretty good job in this by actually telling what different areas of the image the model has looked at based on which it has assigned a particular class. By presenting this, we can get a picture of what our model is doing at backend</p>

How they are different wrt Binomial distribution? Why they are fundamentals behind A/B testing and classification models like Logistic Regression? I also recently saw bit of confusion between these two distribution within the datascience community. Though, this post, I want to explain how these two distributions differ and want to explain the math behind these two distributions.<p>
